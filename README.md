Within the course, the student will become familiar with the principles, options and titles for research, development and innovation. They will also acquire the ability to work as a team member and perform partial tasks.

## 2025 Goals --- Metaphor & Metonymy

We want to document lexical metaphors in multiple languages.

Read:
 * [ChainNet: Structured Metaphor and Metonymy in WordNet](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.266/) (Maudslay et al., LREC-COLING 2024)
 * [Metonymy is more multilingual than metaphor: Analysing tropes using ChainNet and the Open Multilingual Wordnet](https://github.com/unipv-larl/GWC2025/releases/download/papers/GWC2025_paper_36.pdf)  (Bond and Maudslay, GWC 2025)



## Tasks

### Wordnet integration
 * import chainnet to (English) wordnet
 * project to other languages
 * visualize
 * compare to corpus
 * look at sentiment
 * Look for errors
   * find exceptions to patterns
   * evaluate and fix
   * mainly direction, but can be type

### Lexical Conceptual Mapping
 * map metaphor pairs to hypernyms
 * look at patterns
 * read MetaNet (or look for more up-to-date source)
 * http://araw.mede.uic.edu/~alansz/metaphor/METAPHORLIST.pdf
 * try to map
   * try to generate labels for new ones

### Compare and contrast with UniMet
 * see where we differ and why
 * evaluate
 * write script to merge to wordnets (like task A)
 * https://github.com/kbatsuren/UniMet


### Extend to different POS 
 * project from nouns using derivational links
   * hand annotate a subset to see what we are missing
   * look at other approaches
 * see what her have in other data sets (like MetaNet)


### Look at xlingual morphological patterns
 * often a zero derivation in one language will be marke din another
 * use this to type the links

 * use wordnet
 * use wiktionary
 ** find hypernym from definition
 ** look at senses with different hypernyms (use PERSON/ANIMAL but make it programmable)
 * focus on a language or focus on multilingual?
 * look at positive negative?
 * look at borrowing?

 * maybe also look at morpholical links
 * also at lexical-conceptual mapping


### Parse DBnary
 * try to find hyponyms
 * try to match trope classes




### Extend wordnet with DBnary
 * https://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/
 * read data (with RDF lib) 
 * attempt to map to wordnet synsets
 * use definition, use translations
