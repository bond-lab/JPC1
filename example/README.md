Note: this takes time, both to download (only once) and to loop through every language

reads the data from chainnet, converts to the OMW sense ids.

prints all the tropes (metaphors and metonyms) out

loops through all the tropes and looks for entries in any language that differ only by a suffix or affix

saves them in build/deriv-links.tsv
