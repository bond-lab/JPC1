\section{Introduction}

The goal of this task was to investigate lexical--conceptual mappings in a programmable way, with a focus on semantic relationships between categories such as PERSON and ANIMAL. While the assignment suggested approaches such as manual inspection of dictionary entries or cross-linguistic comparison, we approached the problem computationally.

Our objective was to automatically detect semantic category shifts (e.g. ANIMAL $\rightarrow$ HUMAN) using structured lexical resources. Specifically, we integrated:

\begin{itemize}
\item ChainNet – which encodes metaphorical relations between WordNet senses
\item CoreLex – which assigns WordNet noun senses to coarse semantic types
\end{itemize}

By combining these resources, we aimed to identify not only whether a semantic shift occurs, but also what conceptual mapping it represents.

\section{Background}

This work builds on recent research showing that tropes such as metaphor can be analyzed computationally using structured lexical data.

\subsection*{Resources}

We used three primary resources:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{OMW English 1.4 (ChainNet)} – a version of WordNet extended with metaphor relations between senses.
\item \textbf{CoreLex} – an ontology mapping WordNet noun senses into 39 semantic types such as ANIMAL, HUMAN, ARTIFACT.
\item \textbf{Python wn library} – used to load and query the ChainNet XML lexicon.
\end{itemize}

These resources allowed us to move from manual analysis toward a fully programmable pipeline.

\section{Approach}

Our approach evolved during development.

An earlier version relied on extracting synset offsets and aligning them via the NLTK interface. This proved unreliable due to version mismatches between resources.

The final pipeline instead uses a sense--index mapping strategy directly within the wn environment.

The implemented system (\href{https://github.com/YOUR-REPO-LINK}{analyze\_shifts\_final.py}) performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Loads the ChainNet XML lexicon into the wn database
\item Retrieves noun senses for a set of polysemous words
\item Extracts metaphor relations between senses
\item Dynamically resolves metaphor targets, even when they belong to different lemmas
\item Maps sense index positions to CoreLex semantic types
\end{enumerate}

Only forward metaphor relations were traced in order to avoid double-counting bidirectional links.

\section{Results}

The system identified 11 distinct semantic shifts.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Source Type & Target Type \\
\midrule
Chestnut & NATURAL\_BODY & PSYCHOLOGICAL\_FEATURE \\
Star & NATURAL\_BODY & FORM \\
Mouth & PART & SPACE \\
Mouth & PART & PHYSICAL\_OBJECT \\
Mouth & PART & ARTIFACT \\
Arm & PART & ARTIFACT \\
Leg & PART & ARTIFACT \\
Dog & ANIMAL & HUMAN \\
Rat & ANIMAL & ARTIFACT \\
Snake & NATURAL\_BODY & PHYSICAL\_OBJECT \\
Hawk & ANIMAL & HUMAN \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The most frequent shift patterns were:

\begin{itemize}
\item PART $\rightarrow$ ARTIFACT
\item ANIMAL $\rightarrow$ HUMAN
\item NATURAL\_BODY $\rightarrow$ PHYSICAL\_OBJECT / FORM
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

The results reveal systematic conceptual mappings.

Mappings from PART to ARTIFACT illustrate how human anatomy serves as a structural model for objects. For example, containers may have a ``mouth'' and furniture may have ``legs''.

Mappings from ANIMAL to HUMAN rely on behavioral traits rather than physical resemblance, as seen in metaphorical uses of words such as \textit{hawk}.

An inconsistency was observed in the classification of \textit{chestnut}, where a physical anatomical feature was mapped to a psychological category. This highlights limitations of fully automated semantic ontologies.

All observed shifts moved from more concrete domains toward more abstract or socially interpreted ones, supporting the directional nature of metaphor.

\section{Conclusions}

This project demonstrates that semantic shifts can be detected automatically by integrating structured lexical resources. By refining the mapping between ChainNet and CoreLex using sense-index alignment, we developed a robust pipeline capable of identifying conceptual mappings such as ANIMAL $\rightarrow$ HUMAN.

Future work could extend this approach cross-linguistically or explore connections between semantic shift and morphological processes such as zero-derivation.

\subsection*{Author Contributions}

The code represents collaborative work resulting from extensive brainstorming and problem-solving. The collaboration included understanding the assignment objectives, analyzing and reconciling the ChainNet and CoreLex datasets, designing and implementing the semantic-shift detection pipeline, and verifying the results to ensure accuracy and completeness.

The original report was written by Dominik Fr\'anek and subsequently refined to its final form by Barbora Mahdalov\'a.

While the computational analysis and report content were developed independently by the authors, minor assistance from AI tools was used to improve language clarity and formatting.
