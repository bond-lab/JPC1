# Look at xlingual morphological patterns
 * often a zero derivation in one language will be marked in another
 * use this to type the links

 * use wordnet
 * use wiktionary
 ** find hypernym from definition
 ** look at senses with different hypernyms (use PERSON/ANIMAL but make it programmable)
 * focus on a language or focus on multilingual?
 * look at positive negative?
 * look at borrowing?

 * maybe also look at morpholical links
 * also at lexical-conceptual mapping



## Next Tasks 
 * Read  [Metonymy is more multilingual than metaphor: Analysing tropes using ChainNet and the Open Multilingual Wordnet](https://github.com/unipv-larl/GWC2025/releases/download/papers/GWC2025_paper_36.pdf)  (Bond and Maudslay, GWC 2025)
 * try to get this running:  https://github.com/bond-lab/chainnet-xling
