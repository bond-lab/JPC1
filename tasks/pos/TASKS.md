# Extend to different POS 
 * project from nouns using derivational links
   * hand annotate a subset to see what we are missing
   * look at other approaches
 * see what they have in other data sets (like MetaNet)


## Next Tasks 

 * try to annotate some by hand
   * pick a verb or two and go through all the senses
   * maybe _illuminate_ or _uncover_
 * maybe look at the http://araw.mede.uic.edu/~alansz/metaphor/METAPHORLIST.pdf
