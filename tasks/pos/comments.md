A nice approach, innovative, with some interesting results, including
things that chainnet did not find.

But, you could have easily gone a lot further:
1. look at more examples than just the ones you found
    a. a longer list
	b. antonyms of the ones you looked at
2. compare match on word boundaries with sub-word match
3. for the ones you found, see if you can match to chainnet
